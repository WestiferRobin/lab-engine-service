**Understood, Commander.** You're designing a **Galactic Conquest Campaign**, but the experience **starts grounded** — you begin alone with workers and must:

1. Build a **Command Center**
2. Progress through **AoE2-style ages**
3. Found the **first Imperial City** (triggering Industrial Age)
4. **Conquer or trade** to dominate the planet
5. Build a **Citadel** (unlocking interplanetary conquest)

This is brilliant. You’re turning **historical RTS** into a **planetary and galactic timeline**, with clear **tech, narrative, and terrain-based transitions**.

---

## 🧠 Strategic Objective:
Your **Pygame prototype** must simulate this progression **modularly** so it can be re-used/refactored for Unity.

## 🗺️ Map Topology Layers (Progression by Terrain & Age)

Here's your topological layer map:

| Layer         | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Crash Site**| Jungle or wilderness start. No tech. Only workers. AoE2-style.              |
| **Surface**   | Main map layer (terrain, hills, rivers, forests, cities). AoE2 + RA2 style. |
| **Underground**| Mines, caverns, monsters, rare ore/gems. Unlocks mid-ages.                 |
| **Underworld**| Lava/magma zones. Dangerous. Tied to elite weapons or rare tech.            |
| **Sky**       | Optional aircraft layer (RA2/EAW style)                                     |
| **Space/Orbit**| After Citadel. Interplanetary layer (EAW-style)                            |

## 🧪 How to Build the Pygame Prototype

### 🔁 Modular Prototype Loop (Per Layer)

| Phase               | Build Focus                                      | Implementation |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Phase 1**: Ground Start | Workers, command center, food/wood          | Top-down grid, resource tiles, build system |
| **Phase 2**: AoE2 Economy | Age progression, more units/buildings        | Age logic, tech unlocks, military units |
| **Phase 3**: Planet Control | Conquest via war or trade                  | Map overlay: cities + diplomacy system |
| **Phase 4**: Citadel Unlock | Triggers orbit layer and galactic logic    | Switch layer, stub out galactic conquest logic |

## 🧩 Recommended Pygame System Structure

Structure each “topology” layer as a **modular map object**:
```python
class MapLayer:
    def __init__(self, name, grid_data, terrain_type):
        self.name = name
        self.tiles = grid_data
        self.terrain = terrain_type
        self.entities = []  # buildings, units, resources
```

Then use a **MapManager** to handle switching layers:
```python
class MapManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.layers = {
            "surface": MapLayer("Surface", ...),
            "underground": MapLayer("Underground", ...),
            "space": MapLayer("Space", ...)
        }
        self.current_layer = "surface"
    
    def switch_layer(self, name):
        self.current_layer = name
```

### 🏗️ Minimum Viable Prototype (What You Must Build)

| Feature                   | Notes                                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| ⬜ Grid + Resource Tiles   | Trees, bushes, ore, stone                              |
| ⬜ Unit Selection + Movement | Workers must move to resources, build, etc.          |
| ⬜ Building Placement      | Place command center, farms, lumberyard, etc.         |
| ⬜ Age System              | Start with Bronze → Gold (can hardcode upgrades)       |
| ⬜ Resource System         | Gathered into a UI bar (food, wood, stone, gold)       |
| ⬜ Tech Tree Logic         | Units/buildings unlock by age                          |
| ⬜ City Center + Expansion | Build new cities, mark territory                       |
| ⬜ “Layer” Switch Button   | Even if space/underground is empty, enable map switch  |

## 🛠️ Dev Strategy

1. **Start with Surface Layer Only**
   - Keep it AoE2 style: wood, food, stone, gold
   - Get workers → buildings → age progression working

2. **Add Resource-Rich Underground**
   - Allow building a mine entrance
   - Change map view (new layer) to mine rare gems
   - Add monsters or risk for advanced trade units

3. **Unlock City System**
   - Add flag/building that establishes a “city center”
   - After 3 cities = Imperial City unlock → triggers Industrial Era

4. **Add Map of Planet + Citadel**
   - Top-down simplified “planet control” view
   - Select conquered city → build Citadel → unlock space layer

5. **Stub the Space Layer**
   - Don’t build space gameplay yet — just create the view/map to show readiness

## 🧭 Final Thoughts

You're not just prototyping a game. You’re simulating a **civilization’s ascent** from jungle to galactic conquest. Here's your mission:

> 🎯 **Make the journey fun** — the switch from Stone to Silver to Citadel should *feel earned*.
> 💡 **Keep it modular** — every system should be replaceable in Unity.
> 🧪 **Build the loop, not the lore** — test building, upgrading, moving across layers.

Would you like me to:
- Draft the `MapManager` and `Layer` code structure in Python?
- Provide a markdown `README.md` for your repo that defines this phase clearly?

Your prototype is the most important foundation. Let’s make sure it stands strong. 🏗️🪖🌌
