# Time Loop Observations of the models nexus of light
"""

Idea:
- Nexus Mechanics is the statics and dynamics of models in time bubbles
- Nexus Theory:
    - Mass Time and Light Time is Space Time
    - Energy is the fabric of Space Time
    - Light is the fabric of Mass Energy
    - Nexus Energy occurs in Bubble Mass
    - Space Time is Bubble of Mass in Time
    - Nexus of Light occurs in Bubbles of Energy in Space Time
    - Nexus of Light delivers Nexus Energy as Warp of Space time due to light of energy
    - A Warp of Space time is due to light of energy of Photons, Electrons, Protons, and Neutrons with Quarks in Mass
    - Proving you need Time Bubbles to explain Time Loops in Warp time due to Space Time's Energy of light

At Big Bang: Start of Space Bubble Bounce
End of the Universe: End of Space Bubble Bounce on Nexus of photons and electrons due to light energy

So:
- Bubble of the universe bangs into nexus of light energy at some time loop
- Time Loops emit light over time due to photons and electrons
- Time Bubbles are made of models of energy going the speed of light
- Light Nexus is times in light from energy of models and gravity space
- Light Nexus is time of energy in models bubble
- Light Nexus in time is bubble of time loops of space in time

Thus:
- Can we find nexus light in any time?
    - Due to light models of colors as energy of electrons and photons
    - Particles create Leptons, Photons, Quarks as Quantum Energy
    - Atoms create Electrons, Protons, Neutrons as Atomic Energy
    - Mass creates Cubes, Squares, Spheres, Circles as Thermal Energy
    - Nexus creates Cylinders, Disks, Pyramids, Hedron as Light Energy
    - 1 Nexus Hedron of Light is in Mass of Space Time at time of loop
    - 1 Nexus Hedron of Light is Mass of a Time Bubble?
- Time dilation of t to t+1 over 1 cycle of time?
    = Can time dilation work for t-1<=t<=t+1 limits in time?
    - Can time dilation work for =inf<=t<=inf loop of time?
    - Prove curve of spacetime in t to t+1 over 1 cycle of nexus light?
- Time dilation of t as energy space of photons and electrons?
    = Photon Light Energy => Nexus Light
    - Atomic Light Energy => Charge of Nexus Light
    - Mol Light Energy -> Thermal of Nexus Light
    - Mass Light Energy -> Gravity of Nexus Light
    - Can atomic and photonic particles be in an atom in models in time?
- Prisms in a Hedron?
    - Define what Prisms are.
    - Define what Hedrons are in Light Nexus
