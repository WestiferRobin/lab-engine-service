- Idea:
    - CRUD for LabSimulation on Project with Python
      - because of cases: SimulationEngine Acceptance Tests
        - ForgeSimulation on Project with Python also UI-3D, UI-2D, and GPT Interfaces
        - StudioSimulation on Project with Python also UI-2D and GPT Interfaces
        - ScribeSimulation on .txt with UI-Text and GPT Interfaces
        - GameSimulation on Save with Python for training 
    - Local is TestSimulation on Model


- Implement Endpoints:
    - /v0/labs
      - /projects => Views of PrismForge with Scribe/Docs, Records, Labs, Studio support
        - /scribe => .txt, .doc, .docx, .beta
          - /{prism_id} read and write to file and chat with user
        - /records => .csv, .xlsx, .gamma
          - /{prism_id} read and write to file and chat with user
        - /labs => .json, xml, html
          - json
          - xhtml:
            - ui
            - html
            - xml
          - /{prism_id} read and write to file and chat with user
        - /studio
          - ?filter=all = { .wav, .mp3, .mp4, .svg, .png, .gif } and scribe support
          - ?filter=text => scribe support
          - ?filter=audio = { .wav, .mp3, .mp4 }
          - ?filter=video = { .mp4, .gif }
          - ?filter=image = { .png, .svg }
        - /game/conquest
          - /{save_id}
          - /{player_id}/{command_id}
          - /{enemy_id}/{enemy_id}
