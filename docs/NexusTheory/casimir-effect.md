1 particle in space time
1 electron in space time
1 atom in space time
1 mole in space time
1 mass in space time
1 force in space time
1 unit in space time

In 0-3 Dimensions
S(t)=S(x,y)=S(x,y,z)=S(x,y,z,w)
r=x+y
z=p+r
w=z+q
I'm an electron flying in shell space
why? It's because of charge:
- <-1,0,1> x <electron, neutron, proton> x <t>


In 4-7 Dimensions
S(t)=S(m,n)=S(m,n,t)=S(m,n,2pi,0)
Of all the light particles in an electron
Electron is in orbital of Photon Light Energy of atom space
Some atom or unit has relationships in Photon Light Energy
Idea:
    - Photon Light Energy: E(t)=h(t)v(t)
    - Shows electron and photon particles
    - Thus electron velocity with photon particles
    - Thus the electron charge with photon particles
    - Thus the electron charge with 1 atom
    - Thus 1 atoms to 16 atoms for m(t)
    

In 8-11 Dimensions
S(theta)=S(theta, phi)=S(theta, phi, psi)

In the 12th Dimensional unit in space time
- It's in Density percents:
  - Nothing exists
  - Something exists
  - Both exists
  - All possible times
- Discussing photon energy as light particles in a electron
