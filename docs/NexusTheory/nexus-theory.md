# Nexus Theory

try to prove casimir effects as a product for market reaction

## Mass Energy limits in Space Time
einstein's model is g(u,v) <= (8pi/c^4)G(u,v) and 0<=E(t)<=mc^2 and 1 photon energy
bohr's model is 1 hydrogen and 1 electron when 1 gram = 1 mole / nxm atoms / Avogadro's Number 
newton's model is 0 <= a(t) <= g when E(t)>=W(t) when W(t)=m(t)a(t)x(t) and E = mgh - (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)kx^2

## Proof of Mass Energy limits in Space Time?
- Quantum Energy Fields with Electromagnatism Fields? Light and EMW Energy?
- Hawking Radiation explains Energy in Warp Space of Event Horizon
- Hawking Bubble explains S(t) as manifold of Space time seeing universe 3-D space
