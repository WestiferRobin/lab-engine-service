This equations will prove from math the relationship of gravity overtime for all known energies

## Newton Mechanics
limits to force:
- limits to position:
  - x(t)=x(0)+v(0)*t+(1/2)a(0)t^2
  - v(t)=v(0)+a(0)*t
  - a(t)=|sqrt(a^2(0)-a^2(t))|=|a(t)|
  - implies and acceleration and velocity as ode
  - shows theta, omega, and alpha as angular acceleration as ode
  - shows <x(t), y(t), z(t), w(t)> as mass in position of S(t)
    - A ball against force field of limits
    - Shows position of ball in S(t)
- limits to energy:
  - E = mgh - (1/2)mv^2
  - (1/2)kx=mgh - (1/2)mv^2
  - kx=2mgh-mv^2
- E = 0 and a(t)=a(0)+t*i
- W = F(t)x(t) - (1/2)m(t)v(t)^2
- W(t) = m(t)a(t)x(t) - (1/2)m(t)v(t)^2
- P(t) = W(t)/t
## Einstein Mechanics
limits to gravity when g < 8*pi*G/c^4
limits to energy when mc^2 >= mgh - (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)kx(t)^2
## Bohr Mechanics
limits to mass as cube or sphere
1 gram of mass is made up of mxn atom moles
nxn atoms make up pxq particles
