## Why?

Prism.co:
- NexusEngine: MVP is computational model of OrbProbe on elementary experiement
- PrismDrone
- LegionHive: Data Model in Fotf Simulations 

We need to sell ai companies in all industries as LegionArmada under LegionOrder
Thus we need a LegionSystem in SpaceTime Data Model in FotF Scenarios to build Nexus Theory

Proving:
1.) LegionSystem generates Nexus Theory Data Model
2.) NexusTheory needs Space Time Data Model to fuel NexusTheory
3.) FotfGame fuels ideas for LegionSystems and Prisms
4.) Proving Legionares and Prisms in PrismArmada in LegionareArmada with Avatar(s)
5.) Proving PrismModel and NexusTheory is needed to make PrismDrones from PrismAgents
6.) Showing model for mxn PrismHedrons of uxv DroneHives in LegionArmada in our solar system worker automation on ships and bases scenarios
