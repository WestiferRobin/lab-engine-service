## Age of Empires 2

- Map Design:
  - Observations:
    - Trees can be alone or in group
    - This applies with Stone and Ore but in group only
    - Same with bushes but only for berries otherwise just general bush/tall grass
    - Doesn't have day and night cycle so assume this is going to be at play
    - Animals are based on Meat except for Fish. Fish are just a tile with an animation based on fish size
    - Birds are in the game too as well, but this is visual.
    - In AOE2, units and buildings are done by Food, Wood, Stone, and Gold in that order
    - Progression should be more of forced shape:
      - ex.) Wood walls are never used. They should be made around the Center with Farms and walls.
      - This means that we need a tutorial onto the next stage
      - This also means we need to have a base design JUST LIKE THE SHIP OF THE OLD DESIGN.
  - Resources:
    - Animals and Bushes for Food
      - Tall grass can become Bushes for Food?
      - Meat: Carnivore, Omnivore, and Herbivore

        - Tobacco, Grapes, Hops, and Cotton
    - Trees/Forests for Wood based on Biomes
      - LOOK AT MAP CREATION IN AEO 2
    - "Gold" and Stone for Money on Market
      - If we need gems then an underground feature is needed. this means we need topological levels.

  - Fog of War in this game is perfect. Hue at 50 percent vs 100 percent in a units or building view.
  - When a section is conquered or radar update then the section is exposed
  - When configuring keybindings and shortcuts, this game is the basis of all RTS games.
  - If breeding is a feature then we need those children to learn in schools and universities to become heroes?
