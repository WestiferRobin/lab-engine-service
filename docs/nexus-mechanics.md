# Nexus-Mechanics

## Problem?: Too much focus without result?
- No new technology with Quantum Mechanics in Industry for Energy, Vehicles, and Drones
  - String Theory isn't working => Still Theoretical so No Product no Result but possible.
  - Technology is advancing with DC and AC devices: dTechnology/dDevices
  - Vehicles are still primitive while Technology is advancing: dVehicle/dTechnology
  - Governments have problem with energy: dGovernment/dTime
  - Vehicles with Pilots: dPilots/dVehicles
  - Vehicles last overtime: dVehicles/dTime
- No bridge to General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics
  - We have no bridge to Classical Mechanics
  - We have no bridge to Thermodynamics Mechanics
  - We have no bridge to Electromagnetism
  - We have no bridge to Statistical Mechanics
  - We have no bridge to Chemistry especially in Statics and Dynamics with Materials


## Orb Drone System Problem with Nexus Mechanics
aka: Orb Drone System Problem with Statistical Mechanics in Statics and Dynamics in Classical Mechanics
      
    Assumptions
      - Unknown Metal substance
      - Has Technology with Some Field Dynamics in:
        - Electromagnetism Mechanics
        - Relative Mechanics
        - Thermodynamics Mechanics
        - Quantum Mechanics
        - Classical Mechanics
        - Statistical Mechanics in Statics and Dynamics

    Does Quantum Mechanics Alter F_thrust = m(a + g)?
      - m = Mass of the Drone
      - a = Acceleration provided by the thruster
      - g = Earth's Gravity
      - F_thrust = (Energy Release Rate)/(Exhaust Velocity)
      - F_thrust = m(a + g) = (dE/dt)
        - UAP is ejecting Particles or Photons at relativistic velocity v_exhaust
        - v_exhaust(t) = v_0 + a * t
      - F_thrust = m_exhaust(t)(a + g)

    Energy Conversion:
      - Assume the Quantum Energy Source ejects Particles or Photons at relativistic velocity
      - F_thrust = m_exhaust(t) * v_exhaust(t) = m_exhaust(t)(a + g)

    Energy Density Consideration:
      - Quantum sources (e.g., antimatter annihilation) provide orders of magnitude 
        - More energy per unit mass than chemical or nuclear reactions.
        - Enabling high thrust with minimal mass loss.

    So, Yes it does with a Quantum Energy Source in Context
      - Energy Mechanisms in Quantum Mechanics:
        - Annihilation Energy: From matter-antimatter annihilation: E=mc^2.
        - Zero-Point Energy: Exploiting vacuum fluctuations E=(hw/2)dw
        - Quantum Tunneling: Facilitating nuclear reactions or other phenomena
      - In a Non-Relativistic Context:
        - Quantum mechanics affects the energy source but not the classical equation directly
        - F = P_quantum / v_exhaust
      - In a Relativistic Context:
        - Quantum mechanics introduces significant effects:
          - E=(dm/dt)c^2 => m(t) = m_0 + (v_0 * t) + ((1/2) * a * t^2)
          - F_relativistic = (m(t) * c^2)/(v_exhaust + realtive * v(t))
