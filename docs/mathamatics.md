        - Theorem 1:
            - The world is complex so use variables
            - So All Real Numbers of Rationals and Irrational Numbers
                - Need Complex Numbers for Irrational Numbers
                - Need Rational Numbers for Scalers
                - Need Scalers(1) for Vectors(2), Matrices(3), Tensors(4), Prism(t)
                - Proves we can solve 0-4 Dimensions for t Dimensions
                - so t has t%4 Dimensions therefore t,t-1,t-2,t-3,t-4 Dimensions
                - Proves were in 0-4 + sum(t to t-4) = 4 + 5 = 9 Dimensions
            - Theorem 2 Is the 0-D Dimension Coordinates for Systems:
                - With position as scalers
