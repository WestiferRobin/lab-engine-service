## MVP PIPELINE: From Solar System to Profit (Adjusted for Taxes)

### 🪐 1. Celestial Cycle Engine (The Cosmos Input)
- Pull real-time planetary data (ephemeris) via NASA JPL or Swiss Ephemeris
- Track:
  - Moon Phases 🌕
  - Mercury Retrogrades 🔄
  - Planetary Transits (e.g. Jupiter in Aries ♃♈)
  - Eclipses / Solar Events ☀️
- Output: Clean JSON feed of **daily cosmic conditions**
- NOTE: Consider all astrology ideas with real solar data too
---

### 📉 2. Market Data Feed (The Earth Input)
- Pull daily market data:
  - S&P 500 (SPY)
  - VIX (volatility index)
  - Bitcoin / ETH
  - RSI / MACD indicators
- Use: `yfinance`, Alpaca API, or paper trade sources
- Output: Clean, normalized market feed

---

### 🧠 3. PrismDrone AI Oracle (The Mind)
- AI interpreter that merges:
  - Celestial Cycle Engine 🪐
  - Market Data Feed 📉
  - Optional news/headlines 🗞️
- Uses GPT or custom LLM for:
  - Strategy suggestions
  - Market interpretation
  - Daily guidance
- Interface: Command line or Web UI

---

### 🌀 4. Strategy Layer (The Wings of the Goose)
Start with 1–2 core strategies:

#### 📈 Lunar Pulse Strategy
- Buy SPY call 1 day after New Moon if RSI < 30
- Sell 3 days later or at +7% gain
- Logs win/loss, matches historical pattern

#### 🪐 Saturn Gate Strategy
- Long swing trades based on Saturn transits
- Focus on “expansion or contraction” themes
- Use AI to backtest past Saturn alignments

---

### 🧾 5. Tax-Aware Profit Tracker (The Nest)
- Set post-tax income goal: `$6,000/month`
- Assume 25–30% tax bracket
- Tracker adjusts strategies & scaling to hit:
  - ~$8,000 gross trading profit/month
  - Logs net income after tax
- Optional: Export to tax log / spreadsheet

---

### 📊 6. Goose Dashboard (The Egg Hatchery)
- Display:
  - Net progress: `$1,200 / $6,000`
  - Today’s alignment: “Moon in Leo, VIX up, RSI oversold”
  - AI forecast: “Buy ETH swing, hold 5 days”
  - Strategy success rates
  - Journal entry from PrismDrone
