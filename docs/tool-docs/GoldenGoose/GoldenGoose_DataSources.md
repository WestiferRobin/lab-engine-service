You're building a **multi-source intelligence engine** for financial and planetary correlation — *Golden Goose* is essentially the **brain that trades through time using the stars and the Earth itself as context**.

Here’s how to organize all your data sources under the top-most hierarchy:

---

## 🔱 GOLDEN GOOSE DATA HIERARCHY

### 1. **🪐 SOLAR DATA**
_Tracks planetary positions, gravitational fields, zodiac constellations._

**Sources:**
- 🌌 NASA JPL SPICE Kernels (e.g., `de421.bsp`, `de440s.bsp`)
- ☀️ Skyfield for ephemeris extraction
- 🌠 Zodiac constellations via Skyfield `load_constellation_map`
- 📈 Calculated planetary geometry (orbital inclination, eccentricity, alignment, etc.)

**Includes:**
- `planet_x, planet_y, planet_z`
- `moon_x, moon_y, moon_z`
- `zodiac_signs`
- `alignment_patterns`

**Notes:**
- skyfield api does this for all

---

### 2. **🌍 EARTH DATA**
_Links Earth’s conditions to financial behavior._

**Sources:**
- 🧭 NOAA / NASA for global **weather + climate**
- 🌎 GeoPandas / Natural Earth for **geospatial boundaries**
- 🧪 Copernicus / ECMWF for **satellite Earth observation**
- 🌡️ Earthquake, solar flare, geomagnetic index data
- 🌪️ Regional economic shocks (e.g., disasters, wars)

**Includes:**
- `temperature, humidity, pressure`
- `natural_disasters: earthquakes, hurricanes`
- `seasonal cycles (equinox, solstice)`
- `solar flares / geomagnetic index`
- `latitude/longitude-based metrics`

---

### 3. **📈 MARKET DATA**
_The economic pulse of the material world._

**Sources:**
- 📊 Yahoo Finance => Free and smooth
- 📉 Historical pricing data (OHLC, volume) => OHLCV is the base dataset for all stocks and mutal funds
- 📰 News sentiment (e.g., FinBERT or GPT on articles) => GPT all the way... but look at 
- 💸 Economic indicators (GDP, CPI, interest rates)

**Includes:**
- `ticker_data: AAPL, SPY, BTC-USD, etc.`
- `SP500 index, Nasdaq, Dow, FTSE, Nikkei`
- `financial ratios (P/E, RSI, MACD, etc.)`
- `trade signals, volatility, momentum`

---

## 🔁 OTHER INTEGRATIONS (Optional/Future)

### 4. **🏛️ ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY**
- 🌐 World Bank, IMF, WTO for:
  - GDP per country
  - Imports/exports
  - Resource exploitation by region
  - Sovereign debt, war, inflation

---

### 5. **🧠 HUMAN DATA**
- 🧍 Psychology of market behavior (fear/greed index)
- 📅 Calendar & cultural events (holidays, elections, war)
- ⏱️ Time-based memetics (e.g., how people react to Q1 vs Q4 earnings)

---

### 6. **💥 CHAOS FACTORS**
- Black swan events
- Supply chain breakdowns
- Pandemic data
- Social unrest (from Twitter trends or Reddit sentiment)

---

## 🧠 STRATEGIC GOAL

To train or operate **Golden Goose**, your system should be able to:

- Align **cosmic cycles** with **economic cycles**
- Weigh **natural indicators** (e.g., solar flares, pressure drops) as *volatility precursors*
- Correlate **planetary alignments** to **market momentum**
- Combine macro indicators with **per-ticker intelligence**
- Provide **human-interpretable narratives or heatmaps** for each data fusion layer
