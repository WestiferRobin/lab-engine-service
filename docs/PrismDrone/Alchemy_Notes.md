# **Alchemy is an artistic or imaginative science**

Chemistry was born of alchemy with the introduction of calculus in motion


## Why consider such an idea?
    1. Newton used Alchemy to invent the laws of motion, earth gravity, and ode calculus
    2. Many well Scientists and Artists use Alchemy Robert Boyle
    3. Actually both founders of Calculus did
    4. No Alchemy practice was done since this industrialization till beyond 1800s
    5. Alchemy was known during the times of Egypt, Mayan, and Ancient times around the world
    6. In Nexus Theory, I see artistic ideas of quantum physics, general realitvity, and mass chemistry with occult
    7. The occult studies where science was made is legit and talks of stagnation of stem could explain this

## Hypothesis
    1. Historically it is possible to have calculus in acient times
    2. Imply science under imaginary rules can describe imaginary ideas of alchemy into physics
        a. Implies we have a model of S(t) with Physics and Chemistry for Mass
        b. Implies we have a model of Z(t) with Mathamatics and Energy for Mass 
        c. Implies we already have a model Z(t) = dS/dt for Mass in any time
        d. Shows we have Z(t)=omega(2pi)-omega(0) as a time-loop in complex numbers
    3. Casimir Effects occur at 1 N of mass 1 kg

## TODO
- We need some refinements with Alchemy and Salt
  - For the four pillars of earth's elements => ex.) Water is Liquid at 0-100 C 
  - For the salt we need to do tests with Earth Salt with Water and it's reactions
- We need to do refinements with Chemistry and Physics
  - Atom geometry is of atomic particles of electron, proton, and neutron
  - Quantum
