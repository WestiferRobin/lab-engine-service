# NEXUS FRAMEWORK
This is the sandbox for my thesis and work. Prism.co supports Nexus Theory and Avatar Theory.

## Phase 1: Foundation - Pre-AI
- FotF => RTS game for player to conquer galaxy with Prism Drones
- Prism.co Infrastructure:
  - Golden Goose => automated hedge fund
  - Mood Wave => automated social media for money and marketing

## Phase 2: Business - Full-AI
- Hive => Portal to Prism Agents
- Book => The Nexus of Light (Talks about the Nexus in Science, Philosophy, and History as a book or series)
- Scribe => Mental Health app to help users manifest their goals

## Phase 3: Drone Bots - Bot-AI simulations
- Prism Drone => Prism Agent as a Bot
- Orb Drone => UAP inspired craft
- Arch Legion => Orb and Prism Drones but like FotF

## Phase 4: Bot Work - R&D business built on AIs and User
- Nexus Theory
  - Build the PrismDrone on a HiveDevice
  - Build the OrbDrones piloted PrismDrones and Users
    - NexusEngine => Atmosphere Vehicles
    - LightEngine => Interstellar Vehicles
  - Build the Arch Legion based on PrismDrones, HiveDevices, and OrbDrones
