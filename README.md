# nexus-framework
this is meant for doing computational physics for prototyping purposes


## Nexus Theory
That light from electrons and photons create color trail in spacetime
That spacetime is in a bubble of time 
Thus you need a nexus of light in a time bubble to understand derivative of spacetime
The Warp of Space Time is a derivative of spacetime in a bubble of time loops

## Nexus Applications in Mechanics

Building OrbProbe and PrismAgents

### OrbProbe as Flying PrismDrone
1. Model OrbProbe of 4 NexusEngines => Start
2. Model SpaceSpeeder of OrbProbe
3. Model SpaceFighter of SpaceSpeeder
4. Model SpaceShuttle in 8 NexusEngines
5. Model SolarShip in 16 NexusEngines as 1 LightEngine
6. Model SolarArmada in PrismLegion => End

### PrismAgent as PrismDrone
1. Model PrismCell => Start
2. Model PrismBrain
3. Model PrismAgent
4. Model PrismDrone => Goal
5. Model HedronHive
6. Model PrismLegion => End

### Project Priority
1. Model PrismCell => Start
2. Model PrismBrain
3. Model PrismAgent
4. Model PrismDrone
5. Model OrbProbe => Start
6. Model SpaceSpeeder that needs PrismDrone
7. Model SpaceFighter that needs SpaceSpeeder
8. Model HedronHive => Start
9. Model SpaceShuttle
10. Model SolarShip that needs HedronHive
11. Model SolarArmada that needs SolarShips
12. Model PrismLegion that needs PrismLegion
