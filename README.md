# PrismProject: MVP Model of Prism.hive (formerly Prism.co)

- central platform for user drone interaction in workflows for automation
  - Game: Legion vs Legion War and Trade Games
    - Find Tribal relationships in colonies
    - Map data to modern day colonies with limited resources to do company work for trade for prism-hive
    - Why is to build prism-drone with prism-ai using it as a logos seeking ai
    - Idea:
      - I make a dataset on native myth/legends/theology/science on a prism-drone's llm with gpt prompts
      - prism-drones should figure out how to work in a team in war and trade missions
      - prism-drones should figure out how to work in a team for the legion colony on planet to survive
        - diplomacy with other Tribes of Outposts, Nations of Cities, States of Bases, and Factions of Citadels with Fortress
        - war with other Tribes, Nations, States, and Factions
      - simulation is generated and is learned by what the prism-drone is seen with the gnosis and egos models inside the prism-drone model
  - Labs: Drive, Code, Terminal, 2D-UI in statics and dynamics images, video, and audio, and same UI for 3D
    - Money = Material made of atoms
    - Mark rates of atoms per market density for money reasons
    - Version-0 Projects: Spheres and Cubes with Squares and Circles
    - Version-1 Projects: Triangles and Pyramids with Rectangles and Prism (rectangular prism in 3D is in the dataset)
    - Version-2 Projects: Mass and Energy Relationships for Solid, Liquid, Gas, and Plasma from 0-11 Dimensions based on string theory
    - Version 3-7 as legion-project for user running prism-hive behind web-site with user's legion in a system
      - Version-3 Projects: Drone Model from prism-conquest
      - Version-3 Projects: Speeder Model from prism-conquest
      - Version-4 Projects: Shuttle Model from prism-conquest
      - Version-5 Projects: Ship Model from prism-conquest
      - Version-6 Projects: Colony Model from prism-conquest
      - Version-7 Projects: Legion Model from prism-conquest
  - Studio: Engine service system of making Videos, Images, Posts, Books, and ComicBooks with prism-drones using prism-labs
    - Money = Clicks and Views based on terms
    - Market: Education, Science, History, Spirituality = Fiction Book Model and Album Model
    - Goal: Market Cases
      - Tiktok Videos for Highlights and Facts/Wisdom
      - Youtube Videos for Podcasts and Spiritual Music Mix
      - Instagram for Promotion and Facts/Wisdom
      - Twitter for Promotion and Facts/Wisdom
      - Date: 01/01/2026 ready with some momentum before 12/25/2025 on 08/2025 momentum
      - AC:
        - Videos for Youtube and Tiktok with Images for Icon
        - Images for Instagram and Youtube
        - Twitter for Instagram, Tiktok, Youtube, and PrismHive source
  - Forge: Drive, Scribe(Word/Docs), Sheets(Excel), Todo(Trello), Chronos(Calander with automation tasks for drones and users with forge)
    - Note: Divide ForgeApps into Drive, Scribe, Todos, and Chronos into separate lite apps.
    - Idea: web has full suite while mobile references each other like google-drive with microsoft-word recognitions with prism-drones
  - Hive: PrismHive is GPT-Drone system with 1-12 drones per tier case at scale with market place
    - Serves like amazon with gpt for prism-drones
    - Serves like creation with prism-drones and api docs and portals
    - Serves like social media as well with amazon and portal to prism-drones with prism-forge for prism-drone creation with prism-labs or import
  - Version 2: 2030 and beyond
    - Hive with VR/XR world with Unreal in C++
      - Minecraft/Valorant/Rimworld/Rivals in Galaxy Map in prism-conquest
      - make c++ api and then design around c api design with validation in python script tests
    - Bots with C API in Embedded Linux and Python Scripts
      - Hive Bot: like Alexa but in a PI or PC app on Computer
      - Prism Bot: prism-drone in bot-drone with servos and bot app integration on terminal app
