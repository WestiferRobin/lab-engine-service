# nexus-framework
this is meant for doing computational physics for prototyping purposes


## Nexus Theory
That light from electrons and photons create color trail in spacetime
That spacetime is in a bubble of time 
Thus you need a nexus of light in a time bubble to understand derivative of spacetime
The Warp of Space Time is a derivative of spacetime in a bubble of time loops

## Nexus Applications in Mechanics

Building OrbDrone and PrismAgents

### OrbDrone as Flying PrismDrone
1. Model OrbDrone of 4 NexusEngines => Start
2. Model SpaceSpeeder of OrbDrone
3. Model SpaceFighter of SpaceSpeeder
4. Model SpaceShuttle in 8 NexusEngines
5. Model StarShip in 16 NexusEngines as 1 LightEngine
6. Model SolarArmada in UserLegion => End

### Prism as PrismDrone
1. Model Cell => Start
2. Model Organ -> Brain
3. Model Prism
4. Model Drone => Goal
5. Model Hive
6. Model Legion => End
