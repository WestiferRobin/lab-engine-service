Synthesis: A + B → AB
Decomposition: AB → A + B
Single Replacement (Displacement): A + BC → AC + B
Double Replacement (Metathesis): AB + CD → AD + CB
Combustion: A substance reacts with O₂ to produce CO₂, H₂O, and energy.
Acid-Base Neutralization: An acid donates H⁺ and a base donates OH⁻ to form water (and usually a salt).
Redox Reaction (Oxidation-Reduction): Oxidant + Reductant → Reduced form + Oxidized form
