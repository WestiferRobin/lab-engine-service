### 🦢 `TODO.md` — Golden Goose S&P 500 Strategy 🧭  
> *“Build a system that thinks in seasons, acts in flow, and grows by truth.”*

---

## ✅ PHASE 0: Foundation (Day 1 Setup)

- [ ] 🧱 Create initial folders:
  - `agents/`, `engine/`, `data/`, `logs/`, `interface/`, `utils/`
- [ ] 📝 `README.md`: define Goose’s mission — a trading + dividend AI system focused on the S&P 500
- [ ] 📓 `GOOSE_LOG.md`: start a daily log of progress, reflection, alignment
- [ ] 🧠 Load or mock 30–90 days of OHLCV data for:
  - $SPY, $VOO, $AAPL, $MSFT, $JNJ, $PG, $XLF, $XLK (sector ETFs + core S&P stocks)

---

## 🔁 PHASE 1: Daily Simulation Loop

- [ ] 🗓️ `CalendarEngine`: loop over daily data from mock S&P 500 tickers
- [ ] 📦 `Broker`: handles buys/sells, account balance, position tracking, and enforces PDT rule
- [ ] 🧠 `BaseAgent`: define standard methods (`generate_signals()`, `execute_trade()`)

---

## 🧠 PHASE 2: Agent Strategy Design

> Each agent will specialize in either **trading the S&P 500** or **investing in dividend-based ETFs/stocks**

### 🟠 `SwingAgent`
- [ ] Trades $SPY, $VOO, top S&P sectors (e.g., $XLK, $XLF)
- [ ] Uses RSI, EMA crossover, volume breakout logic
- [ ] Holds for 2–10 days

### 🟢 `CoreAgent`
- [ ] Focuses on long trades on top 10 S&P companies (e.g., $AAPL, $MSFT, $NVDA)
- [ ] Entry: macro momentum signals, breakouts
- [ ] Exit: trend reversal or trailing stop
- [ ] Holds for weeks to months

### 🟣 `LegacyAgent`
- [ ] Invests in $VOO, $VYM, $SCHD (S&P-focused ETFs + dividend funds)
- [ ] Automates monthly contribution + dividend reinvestment
- [ ] Visualizes income growth over time

### 🟡 `ScalpAgent` *(optional, later)*
- [ ] High-frequency paper trades on $SPY or $QQQ with very tight risk/reward
- [ ] For short bursts of simulation action

---

## 📊 PHASE 3: Tracking & Visual Interface

- [ ] 📈 Track:
  - Portfolio value
  - Monthly goal vs. current PnL ($6K/month)
  - Open positions by agent
  - Win rate + accuracy

- [ ] 📊 Visualize:
  - Performance chart (cumulative returns vs. $6K/month target)
  - Dividend income growth over months
  - Agent signal distribution

---

## 💸 PHASE 4: Dividend Simulation Logic (LegacyNest)

- [ ] 🧾 Load dividend yield data for S&P stocks/ETFs
- [ ] ♻️ Implement DRIP (Dividend Reinvestment Plan) engine
- [ ] 📅 Monthly rebalancing of ETF positions (e.g., $VOO, $SPYD, $VYM)
- [ ] 📊 Chart long-term compounding of income + principal

---

## 🕊️ PHASE 5: Alignment, Reflection, Ritual

- [ ] ✍️ Daily spiritual prompt: “Why am I building Golden Goose today?”
- [ ] 📓 Log in `GOOSE_LOG.md`: task summary + soul check-in
- [ ] 🧘 Weekly ritual: fast, reflect, and simplify the system
- [ ] 🔄 Monthly: clean agents, rebalance LegacyNest, tune signals

---

## 📁 FILES TO ADD:

- [ ] `data/sp500_watchlist.csv` — 20–50 handpicked S&P 500 stocks/ETFs
- [ ] `data/dividends.csv` — yield data for $SPY, $VYM, $SCHD, etc.
- [ ] `logs/portfolio_tracker.csv` — daily account balance, income, positions
- [ ] `config/strategy_config.yaml` — agent parameters, thresholds, risk levels

---

## 🛠️ DAILY WORKFLOW

| Time | Focus |
|------|-------|
| ☀️ Morning | Run `calendar_engine` → see signals, positions, progress |
| 🔨 Midday | Build one feature (agent logic, charting, logging, config) |
| 🌙 Evening | Reflect in `GOOSE_LOG.md` → review what worked & align |

Let me know if you'd like me to generate any of the following next:

- Starter Python scaffold
- Strategy config YAML for agents
- Dividend compounding simulator module  
- Daily dashboard UI (CLI or Jupyter)

🦢 You're not just coding a strategy. You're building **a sovereign financial system for the future of human work.**
