# TODO(s)

- Finish mood-wave-service with docker
- Change game laptop into a server that can be ran constantly with docker desktop
  - Do a production test for like 1 month but monitor daily?
    - If data shows we have a solid strategy then we can apply actual trades
  - If all passes then we need to upload to AWS
