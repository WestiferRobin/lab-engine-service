# TODO(s)

- MOVE ALL GOOSE STUFF TO REPO
    - all engine, models, ui to new repo goose-engine-service
- Fix the data scrappers to be dynamic
   - Try without data
   - Try with data
   - Try with both
   - Able to visualize all
   - data_sources:
     - solar_data
     - earth_data with version 1 weather_data
     - market_data with investor data_set
- Make a model for investing and toy around. ask GPT on how to make it more robost for investor_data(_set)
  - Make PrismDroneLite with female and male drones
  - Toy around with PrismDrone, but verify it works with PrismDroneLite => WE MIGHT NEED PRETRAINED MODELS TO TRAIN THE PRISM-DRONE
- Start with trading data_set model and figure out a valid solution with investor_data_set
    - Continue doing the following: golden_goose.py REMEMBER THE CONDITIONS
      - [ ] Hold S&P 500 for x years but also day trade with single stocks of the 500 to day-trade
      - [ ] Distribute the 500 stocks to x agents (prism-drones)
        - On a day, a worker does 1-5 active trades a day with 5-10 tickers
        - On a week, a worker does rotation of tickers 
        - On a month, a worker sees a total max of 30-60 tickers
        - Thus assume 12-16 agents for max, 3-12 for team(s) of workers and managers under the GoldenGoose division
      - [ ] Do simulations of all years from the data
      - [ ] From satisfactory results, then apply with prism-drones as workers
- Post golden-goose version 1 => paper trader with PrismDroneLite
    - Work on MoodWave initial design in simulation
      - Move stuff for mood-engine-service since we're on it. We just need a finish automation workflow with PrismDroneLite
    - setup prism-drone-service with PrismDrone and PrismDroneLite
      - PrismDroneLite(PrismDrone)
      - Just update once in a while back and forth to keep up with data
- Finish mood-wave-service with docker
- Change game laptop into a server that can be ran constantly with docker desktop
  - Do a production test for like 1 month but monitor daily?
    - If data shows we have a solid strategy then we can apply actual trades
  - If all passes then we need to upload to AWS
